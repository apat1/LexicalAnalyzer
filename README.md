# LexicalAnalyzer

This project was to write a program that can take input and output the type of the tokens in that file.

How to run in Linux:
Compiling on General:

g++ Andy_Pat_Proj1.cc

Running on General:

./a.out <input.txt >output.txt

Result will be in output.txt or whatever you call the text file after the >.
Please delete the output file after every test, or it might append the new 
results to the old ones!
